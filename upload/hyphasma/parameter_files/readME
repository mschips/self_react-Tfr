- pf_ref
    parameter files for simulations without Tfrs

- pf_apo
    parameter files for Apoptosis model
    
- pf_sg
    parameter files for SemiGate model
    
- pf_sg38
    parameter files for SemiGate.38 model
    
- pf_depl
    parameter files for Tfr depletion experiment
    
In each parameter file the following can be found: 

- 'TFR mode of interaction (-1: no interaction)' --> to change TfrModel
    3 : Apoptosis model
    13 : SemiGate model
    19 : SemiGate.38 model
    
- 'Number of initial TFR' --> to change number of Tfrs

- 'Tendency for TFR to stay in the LZ (weight in 0..1)' --> to change Tfrs motility type
    0.1 : 'Tfh-like' indicated by NW abbreviation in file name
    -5 : 'CC-like' indicated by R5 abbreviation in file name
    
NOTE:
to run the simulations parameter files need to be in parameter_files folder as well as in to_run folder
