- upload contains:
    - files to start multiple runs
    - hyphasma folder which contains:
        - files necessary for running the simulations
        - src folder containing code files
        - results folder containing results folder and R scripts to generate the paper figures
        - parameter_files folder (readME file in parameter_files folder)
        
to run hyphasma:
    - move desired parameter files in 'to_run' parameter_files/to_run (note that parameter files need to be both in parameter_files and in to_run)
    - in 'runmulticore_settings' set number of cores (ncores) and number of run per cores (nrunspercore)
    - run 'new_multirun.R' --> this will give number of set runs for each parameter file in hyphasma/parameter_files/to_run; each completed set of runs will automatically be stored in hyphasma/results
    
to generate the figures:
    - in hyphasma/results each set of simulations needs to be placed in the right folder named by '*TfrModel*_model'; eg: SemiGate_*NW* results need to be moved in semigatenw_model folder (readME file in each *_model folder)
    - run 'coll_noPar_paper.R' --> this will generate in each *_model folder the corresponding *_folder containing the necessary csv file to generate the plots
    
    - each R file produces the figure corresponding to file name & supplementary
    - each R file containes lines to modify the selected 'pSelf' and Tfh:Tfr ratio (Tfh_by_Tfr)
    
NOTE:
- due to size restriction, the uploaded csv files are portions of the results presented in the paper
- complete sets can be generated independently
- R files work with any number of simulations
