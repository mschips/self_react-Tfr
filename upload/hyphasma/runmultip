# This shell sript is used to generate a series of identical simulations
# but with different random seed.
# The simulations are started with the parameter file provided as command line parameter.
# The simulations are enumerated according to the command line parameters.
# The simulations are saved in a subdirectory of <results> with the name of the
# parameter file extended by <-all>.
# Each simulation instance is enumerated and saved in a directory with this number
# in this subdirectory.
# 
# Remark: statjob may be called by statjob_mkloop in order to distribute a large
#         number of simulations onto different cores.
# Remark: The set of simulations saved in the subdirectory with the parameter file name
#         may be further analysed by methods saved in <tools>.
